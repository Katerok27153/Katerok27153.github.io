At the same time, hastily prepared slides with many errors in design and content will demonstrate your negligence and become a reason for numerous quibbles. Do not rush to make slides right away, but rather start working with careful preparation.\nPreparatory work First of all, make a detailed presentation plan. In the plan, describe the structure of the report, and in front of each element of this structure, specify the approximate number of slides based on their total number. If the optimal number of slides was not announced to you at the upcoming event, then use common sense: 20-30 slides is too much for a small report, 3-5 slides are too few. Keep in mind that the slides should reflect really meaningful information, and not contain separate pieces of text that will sound in your report without it. First of all, it should be statistical information, various graphs, diagrams, drawings ‚Äî everything that will make your report more visual.\nAN APPROXIMATE PLAN MAY BE AS FOLLOWS: Presentation of the report\nSlide No. 1. Information about the work, the author‚Ä¶ Introduction\nSlide No. 2. Definition of relevance and problems. Table about‚Ä¶ Slide No. 3. Definition of other elements of the introduction. The main part\nSlide No.4. Theoretical provisions‚Ä¶ Slide No. 5. Diagram about‚Ä¶ Slide No. 6. Drawing‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶\nConclusion\nSlide No. 9. Conclusions. Slide No. 10. Contact details. Before creating a presentation, carefully study the requirements for this type of work (see below). If specific requirements have been announced at the event for which the presentation is being prepared, do not ignore them. Ask for sample presentations. If you are preparing a presentation for graduation, be sure to discuss the presentation plan with your supervisor.\nPresentation Requirements The presentation should reflect the content of the report and not have elements that the speaker does not plan to comment on. Each slide should be clear and understandable to the audience for which the report is intended. Slides should not be overloaded with information, as well as be meaningless. It is advisable to use short sentences and, if possible, exclude words that complicate reading or do not carry a load (introductory words, complex terms, long speech phrases, etc.). The colors of individual elements of the slide and all slides as a whole should be combined with each other. If necessary, use the color matching tables. Contrasting tones should be used for the background and text, but the background should not be too bright so as not to tire the audience. Slide design and auxiliary information such as control buttons should not distract viewers from the content of the presentation. The same goes for animation effects. Mistakes when creating a presentation and speaking There are too many slides. With this approach, the audience gets tired of listening to the report and realizes that you have not worked with highlighting the main thing. If you have presented less than a dozen slides, you can also create a negative impression of your hard work and serious attitude. The slides are easy to read on the monitor, but not visible in a large audience. The slides are too mismatched: the text is located at different levels in different slides, decorated with different fonts, the elements are arranged randomly, etc. The presentation causes a negative reaction from a grin to outrage due to overloaded animation effects or too flashy design. There are violations in the content component: the presentation poorly reveals the material of the report, the conclusions are not confirmed by reliable sources, spelling and other errors are present, etc. The slide show does not coincide with the speaker‚Äôs speech. The speaker failed to interest the audience either with the report or with the slides presented. The speaker gets confused in his own presentation, flipping through the slides in different directions, or violates the logic of the narrative. Creating a presentation and refining it The most suitable program for creating a presentation with rich functionality is Microsoft PowerPoint. You can easily present tables, graphs, photos or video clips in it.\nOn the surface, working with it seems simple, since creating slides or inserting text, drawings and other elements into them is not particularly difficult. However, the process becomes much more complicated when it comes to correcting an element. Here it turns out that it is not so easy to change the theme of a separate slide, bring all the elements to a single style or adjust the effects as needed.\nIf you want to make a high-quality presentation, and not work at the ‚Äúblunder‚Äù level, start creating it long before the event or use outside help.\nWhen the presentation is completed, be sure to test it several times in different conditions. The first test is a demonstration on your own computer. ‚Ä¶","date":1713571200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713571200,"objectID":"e54b89ae3306ee5992451969937f3076","permalink":"https://katerok27153.github.io/en/post/post_6/","publishdate":"2024-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/post_6/","section":"post","summary":"In this post, I will tell you how to make a good presentation.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Creating presentations.","type":"post"},{"authors":["Vernikovskaya Ekaterina Andreevna"],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"–†–∞–±–æ—á–∞—è –Ω–µ–¥–µ–ª—è Work week This week has been boring!!!

LaTEX (pronounced ‚Äúlatech‚Äù or ‚Äúlatech‚Äù) is a tool for creating professional documents. It is based on the WYSIWYM editing paradigm (what I see is what I mean), that is, the user is required to focus only on the contents of the document, leaving its formatting to the program. Instead of manually distributing the text on the page, as is done in Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer, you can simply type it, allowing LaTeX to do the rest.\nWhy do I need LaTeX? This tool is used everywhere to create scientific documents, write books, as well as many other forms of publications. It not only allows you to create beautifully designed documents, but also gives users the opportunity to quickly implement such complex elements of a printed set as mathematical expressions, tables, links and bibliographies, obtaining consistent markup across all sections.\nDue to the availability of a large number of open libraries (more on this later), the possibilities of LaTEX become almost limitless. These libraries empower users even more by allowing you to add footnotes, draw diagrams, etc.\nOne of the most compelling reasons why many people use LaTeX is to separate the content of a document from its style. This means that after writing the content, you can easily change its appearance. Similarly, you can create one document style and use it to standardize the appearance of others.\nThis allows scientific journals to create templates for the materials offered for consideration. Such templates have a set markup, as a result of which only the content remains to be added. In fact, there are hundreds of similar templates, ranging from various summaries to slide presentations.\nHighlights of the work Working with LaTeX boils down to writing code that has several basic components and fragments. At the same time, you need to know a few nuances:\nIn-text formulas are surrounded on both sides by $ signs.\nOff formulas (placed in a separate line) are surrounded by $ signs or a pair of commands [ and ]. Formulas enclosed in $ are always centered horizontally.\nIn-text formulas, except for the shortest ones, are typed in a separate line.\nThe following tags are used to align the document: \\flushleft ‚Äî on the left edge, \\flushrigth ‚Äî on the right edge, \\center ‚Äî in the center.\nVerbatim‚Äôs default environment helps to correctly display even complex program code.\nMost mathematical functions and symbols, as well as brackets, matrices and systems of equations in LaTeX syntax are indicated by tags starting with the \\ symbol.\nTo work with expressions that take up more than one line (that is, for careful text wrapping or calculations), you can use the \\ separator.\nThe letters of the Greek language and lemniscate, the infinity symbol and others are entered as tags. stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nHow to use LaTeX in the editor ‚ÄúMyOffice Text‚Äù In MyOffice, LaTeX is used to enter formulas and mathematical expressions.\nTo insert a formula, go to the ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù menu on the toolbar, select the ‚ÄúFormula‚Äù item.\nAfter confirmation, a pop-up window will appear with the ‚ÄúLaTeX Expression‚Äù and ‚ÄúPreview‚Äù fields.\nFor example, we introduce a simple formula for a certain integral of the function f(x) on the interval [a, b]. It will look like this.\n\\int_a^b f(x) dx\nIn the Preview field, you can immediately see what the final formula will look like. This is convenient ‚Äî if necessary, you can make edits immediately on the spot, and not after inserting the formula into the document.\nAfter inserting the formula, it, like any other object in the MyOffice Text editor, can be moved, aligned, and even resized.\nIf you need to edit the formula, just double‚Äîclick on it with the left mouse button - a pop-up window with edit and preview fields will open.\nYou can delete a formula using the [Backspace], [Del] keys or a special button on the toolbar.\nYou can work with more complex formulas in a similar way. For example, consider a conditional function with four variables. For the convenience of reading the formula, we will immediately divide it into lines.\nf(a,b,\\delta, \\gamma) =\n\\frac{\n\\sum \\limits_{n=0}^{\\infty} S_n \\tan \\left( \\frac{104-2\\delta \\pi}{\\mu} \\right)+\\gamma\n}\n{\n\\mathcal{F} {g(a,b)}\n}\nImmediately in the preview field we can see that the formula is displayed correctly.\nFormatting is preserved when pasted into a document.\nIt is noteworthy that the formula editor helps to find errors. For example, if we put an extra space in the \\gamma operator in the specified formula, when inserting the editor ‚ÄúMyOffice Text‚Äù will show an error ‚Äî it will highlight the place in red.\nThis is convenient and protects against accidental errors.\nWith LaTex, you can write not only formulas, but also edit texts.\n","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1711929600,"objectID":"f1ec0fc0e0ee368479d4987729d4201b","permalink":"https://katerok27153.github.io/en/post/post_4/","publishdate":"2024-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/post_4/","section":"post","summary":"In this post, I will tell you about the LaTeX markup language and how to design formulas using this language.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Markup languages.

A version control system is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time and allows you to revert to a specific version later. For file version control, this book will use the source code of the software as an example, although in fact you can use version control for almost any type of file.\nIf you are a graphic or web designer and want to save every version of an image or layout (most likely you will), a version control system (hereinafter referred to as VCS) is just what you need. It allows you to return files to the state they were in before the changes, return the project to its original state, see the changes, see who last changed something and caused the problem, who set the task and when, and much more. Using VCS also means in general that if you break something or lose files, you can safely fix everything. In addition to everything, you will get it all without any extra effort.\nLocal version control systems Many people use copying files to a separate directory as a version control method (perhaps even a time-stamped directory, if they are smart enough). This approach is very common because of its simplicity, but it is incredibly prone to errors. You can easily forget which directory you are in and accidentally change the wrong file or copy the wrong files that you wanted.\nIn order to solve this problem, programmers have long ago developed local VCS with a simple database that stores records of all changes in files, thereby monitoring revisions.\nOne of the most popular VCS was the RCS system, which is still distributed with many computers today. RCS stores sets of patches (differences between files) on disk in a special format, using which it can recreate the state of each file at a given time.\nCentralized version control systems –°–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∞—è —Å–µ—Ä—å—ë–∑–Ω–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–∞, —Å –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–π —Å—Ç–∞–ª–∫–∏–≤–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –ª—é–¥–∏,‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâ—ç—Ç–æ –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç—å –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å —Å –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º–∏ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—á–∏–∫–∞–º–∏. –î–ª—è —Ç–æ–≥–æ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Ä–∞–∑–æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å—Å—è —Å –Ω–µ–π, –±—ã–ª–∏ —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞–Ω—ã —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–µ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª—è –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–π (Centralized Version Control System, –¥–∞–ª–µ–µ CVCS). –¢–∞–∫–∏–µ —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º—ã, –∫–∞–∫ CVS, Subversion –∏ Perforce, –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É—é—Ç –µ–¥–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Å–µ—Ä–≤–µ—Ä, —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—â–∏–π –≤—Å–µ –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–∏ —Ñ–∞–π–ª–æ–≤, –∏ –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∫–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–≤, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞—é—Ç —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã –∏–∑ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä–∞–ª–∏–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–ª–∏—â–∞. –ü—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ CVCS —è–≤–ª—è–ª–æ—Å—å —Å—Ç–∞–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—Ç–æ–º –Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ç—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö –ª–µ—Ç.\nThis approach has many advantages, especially over local VCS. For example, all project developers know to a certain extent what each of them is doing. Administrators have full control over who can do what, and it is much easier to administer CVCS than to operate local databases on each client.\nDespite this, this approach also has serious disadvantages. The most obvious disadvantage is a single point of failure represented by a centralized server. If this server goes down for an hour, then during that time no one will be able to use version control to save the changes they are working on, and no one will be able to share these changes with other developers. If the hard disk on which the central database is stored is damaged, and timely backups are missing, you will lose everything ‚Äî the entire history of the project, not counting the single repository snapshots that were saved on local developer machines. Local VCS suffer from the same problem: when the entire project history is stored in one place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed version control systems This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (hereinafter DVCS) come into play. In DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, or Darcs), clients don‚Äôt just download a snapshot of all files (the state of the files at a certain point in time)‚Äâ‚Äî they completely copy the repository. In this case, if one of the servers through which the developers exchanged data dies, any client repository can be copied to another server to continue working. Each copy of the repository is a complete backup of all data.\nMoreover, many DVCS can simultaneously interact with several remote repositories, so you can work with different groups of people using different approaches at the same time within the same project. This allows you to apply several approaches to development at once, for example, hierarchical models, which is completely impossible in centralized systems.\n","date":1710201600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710201600,"objectID":"fbd7ba47d099228d2a85b3343ad4938d","permalink":"https://katerok27153.github.io/en/post/post_2/","publishdate":"2024-03-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/en/post/post_2/","section":"post","summary":"In this post, I will tell you about the git version control system","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Version control.

It is rare for every user of computer electronic devices, but they have to deal with such a concept as ‚Äúchoosing a file system‚Äù. Most often this happens when it is necessary to format external drives (flash drives, microSD), install operating systems, restore data to problematic media, including hard drives. Windows users are asked to choose the file system type, FAT32 or NTFS, and the formatting method (fast/deep). Additionally, you can set the cluster size. When using Linux and macOS, the names of the file systems may differ. A logical question arises: what is a file system and what is its purpose? The main function of the VZU is the storage of information. Information on external sites The media is stored in the form of files. The file system handles the ordering and processing of these files. File system (English file system) ‚Äî the order that determines the method organizing, storing and naming data in external memory, and providing a user-friendly interface when working with such data. In simple words, a file system is a system for storing files and organizing directories. The file system determines how files will be encoded, stored on disk, and read by the computer. And, if the disk is an array of clusters, then the file system is an instruction for filling these clusters with information. Each operating system has its own type of file organization, that is, its own file system.\nWhat are file, clusters and directory? The objects of the file system are files and directories. From the user‚Äôs point of view, a file is a unit of storage of logically related information; text, graphics, audio, video. From the point of view of organizing data storage on disk, a file is a chain of interconnected clusters. Each Depending on the size, the file receives one or more clusters for storing its data, which can be located in a row, one after another, or scattered throughout the disk. Usually a cluster weighs a few bytes, and how much exactly depends on the size of the disk and on the settings. When a person sets up a file system, they can also choose the cluster size:\nif you make the cluster smaller than recommended, more files will fit on the drive. After all, then there will be no situations when the cluster is actually only partially filled ‚Äî the entire space will be involved; if you increase the cluster size, file access will be faster. The files will be divided into fewer parts. The computer will have to access fewer clusters ‚Äî this will increase the speed. The file system manages clusters, how they will be recorded and stored, and how connections will be organized between them. It also divides and distributes files into clusters, manages writing and reading. A directory (directory, directory, folder) is an object in the file system that simplifies the organization of files. The directory is implemented as a special file, where information about other files and directories on the storage medium is recorded ‚Äî names, physical location, attributes, etc. It is customary to say that a directory contains files or other directories, although in reality it only refers to them, the physical placement of data on the disk is usually not related to the placement of the directory.\nBasic File system functions To know what is stored where, the system has a file table: it contains information about all files. The file system determines how to organize this the table. The methods vary depending on the OS, so different operating systems have different file systems.\nAlso the file system:\ndetermines the size of the clusters ‚Äî blocks of information into which the file is divided; connects ‚Äúpieces‚Äù of information from different clusters into single files; keeps track of which memory cells are currently free, occupied or unavailable; provides application programs with access to files; Providing work with files and data (creating, deleting, changing attributes, reading and writing, searching, etc.) monitors the integrity and security of files, creates recovery points; stores information about files, including name, size, and creation date. The main part FAT file system FAT (English File Allocation Table ‚Äúfile allocation table‚Äù) is a classic file system architecture, which, due to its simplicity, is still widely used for flash drives. It is used in floppy disks, memory cards and some other media. Previously, it was also used on hard drives.\nThe history of FAT creation Developed by Bill Gates and Mark McDonald in 1976-1977. It was used as the main file system in the MS-DOS and Windows 9x operating systems. The FAT file system is a file allocation table, which specifies:\nthe addresses of the logical disk sections intended for file placement; free areas of disk space; defective areas of the disk. Files are usually organized into chains of clusters on disk. This structure is determined by the root directory, which stores information about each file, including its length and location on the disk.
